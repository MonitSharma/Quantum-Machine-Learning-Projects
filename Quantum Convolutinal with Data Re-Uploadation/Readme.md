# Quantum Convolutional Neural Network with Data Re-Uploading Techniquw

## Why do we need Quantum Methods?

The computational capacity requirement keeps growing as a business and academic challenges become more challenging. Applications involving the simulation of massive quantum systems, such as molecules, or the solution of massive linear systems, can be exceedingly costly in computation. This has grown to be one of the driving forces behind the creation of quantum computing. This computational technique uses the properties and theories of quantum systems to process data. For these kinds of issues, quantum computers promise exponential speedups.


Even though research into quantum computers has accelerated recently, the theoretical and technical obstacles still prevent the development of a large-scale quantum computer. Due to process noise, quantum computers as we know them now are severely constrained in terms of qubits and gate operations. The development of Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) has emerged as one of the most promising solutions to these constraints. Applications for quantum machine learning have been proposed in a variety of domains that use this method, including picture categorization.


This research proposed a modification scheme of the VQA-based Data Reuploading Classifier (DRC) for MNIST classification. A binary, four-class, and eight-class classification task reached $99.7\%$, $96.5\%$, and $86.25\%$ of testing accuracy, respectively, using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and Data Re-uploading Classifier with binary representation (DRC-BR) for classification. An improvement in accuracy compared to the previous related VQA works. This research also proposed a DRC-based quantum convolution scheme. Without using PCA, quantum convolution with DRC-BR classifier for binary and four-class classification tasks achieved $98.9\%$ and $89.5\%$ of testing accuracy, respectively. This is a good result compared to the classical Convolutional Neural Network with the same amount of parameters.
